# stunio_frontend

A quick demo of the Stunio App. Connecting students with businesses.

## My Thoughts

I didn't get near to all the functionalities I wanted to implement and but I hope the demo shows the direction I was taking with this project. I also did not focus on the UI design, I have other projects with flutter that showcase that attention detail better that I am happy to share too. I really tried to put emphasis on the seperation of concerns and creating a code base that is easy to work on and well organised. I definitely have areas of the code that I know can I can go back to and improve.
