# stunio_frontend

A quick demo of the Stunio App. Connecting students with businesses. This is the frontend created with Flutter.

## My Thoughts

I didn't get near to all the functionalities I wanted to implement and but I hope the demo shows the direction I was taking with this project. For example I ran out of time to implement a login button so I preform a hot restart to login into the next account. I also did not focus on the UI design, I have other projects with flutter that showcase that attention to detail better that I am also happy to share. 

I really tried to put emphasis on the seperation of concerns and creating a code base that is easy to work on and well organised. I definitely have areas of the code that I know can I can go back to and improve.
